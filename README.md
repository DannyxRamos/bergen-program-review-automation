# Program Review Automation

This project demonstrates how I automated the production of program review documents at Bergen Community College using Python. The script generated PDF reports containing key metrics and tables for academic programs, saving significant time in the review process.

## Tools
- Python (pandas, fpdf / reportlab)
- Excel (data source)

## Note
This repo includes sample Python code and synthetic data. The actual program review documents contain internal data and are not shared here.
